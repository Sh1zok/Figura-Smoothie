# Figura-ActionsLists
For those who don't wanna violate the SquAPI license

This repository contains a *library* for Figura avatars. This library adds methods that are almost identical in functionality to [SquAPI](https://github.com/MrSirSquishy/SquishyAPI)

## Script purpose
Squishy updated the license for SquAPI and now it can't be used for commercial purposes. I need the functionality of SquAPI, but I don't want to violate the license. So I just wrote my own SquAPI.

> [!WARNING]
> This library is under the MIT license, which means you can do whatever you want with it, but don't take credit for it.

## Intallation
The process of installing the script is quite simple
1. Download the script from this repository.
2. Place it in the directory with your avatar.
3. Initialize Smoothie and store it in a variable.

> [!TIP]
> Before using it, explore the features using [This Library Wiki](https://github.com/Sh1zok/Figura-Smoothie/wiki)
